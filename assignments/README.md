# Assignments

Class assignments will be posted here in their own directories (e.g. `assignments/hw1_submissions/`). To download the files, you'll need to [sync](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) your fork to merge in the changes from the main ("upstream") class repo. To submit your completed assignments, you'll open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) from your fork to the upstream repo. ALL PULL REQUESTS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED **TO** THE ASSIGNMENT SUBMISSION BRANCH **FROM** YOUR ASSIGNMENT SUBMISSION BRANCH (e.g. `hw1_submissions`, not `main`). PR's into `main` will not be accepted.

### !!! IMPORTANT !!!
Do not make any changes to files that you find in this directory. You should either create a brand new file or a copy of a file from this directory to work in and submit. Do not just rename the original file as this will delete the original file which you do not want to do. ***YOUR FILES WILL NEED FILENAMES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO YOU.*** To ensure this is the case, please format your submissions in one of the following ways:
- `assignments/assignment_1/assignment_1_<first name>_<last_name>.ipynb`
- `assignments/assignment_1/assignment_1_<XXXX>.ipynb` where `<XXXX>` is the last four (4) digits of your student ID.
