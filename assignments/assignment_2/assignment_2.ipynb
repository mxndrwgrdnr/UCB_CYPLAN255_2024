    "Reminder: in all of the assignments this semester, the answer is not the only consideration, but also how you get to it. It's OK (suggested even!) to use the internet for help. But you _should_ be able to answer all of these questions using only the programming techniques you have learned in class and from the readings.\n",

    "A few keys for success:\n",
    "- Avoid manual data entry\n",
    "- Emphasize logic and clarity\n",
    "- Use comments, docstrings, and descriptive variable names\n",
    "- In general, less code is better. But if more lines of code makes your program easier to read or understand what its doing, then go for it."
