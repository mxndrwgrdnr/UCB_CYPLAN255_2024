    "In this assignment, your task is to put your new skils to use in the form of an open-ended, exploratory data analysis. In particular, I'm looking for you to demonstrate your ability to use the programmatic tools we've been learning to access data, manipulate it, and visualize some findings while working towards the ultimate goal of developing a final project proposal. Please include the following in your assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) A brief summary of the topic (a few sentences)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Access 2 or more datasets, at least one of them using an API (if you are not using any data from an API as part of your project yet, don’t worry about it, and just do this to get some exercise using APIs. You might use it later).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Demonstrate the use of Pandas operations to filter out missing data and/or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Demonstrate your capacity to use some of the \"group-by\" operations to produce pivot tables or statistical summaries of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to produce 2-3 data visualizations of your data to both explore the data and highlight any notable patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Include a short written analysis of your interpretation of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) In a few paragraphs, describe the research question you intend to investigate in your final project, and the plan for the data analysis you intend to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this exercise is intended to help you formulate your project topic. But it is not a binding contract. Your project will most likely evolve over the rest of the semester. So use this as an opportunity to be creative, throw some ideas against the wall and see what sticks. I will release the final project guidelines shortly. In the meantime, dig in!\n",
    "\n",
    "And as always, please submit this assignment both as a PR on GitHub along with the URL of your PR on bCourses"

    "For our final project, we want to investigate travel patterns in San Francisco, particularly involving car use as it relates to demographics and transit infrastructure. For our initial analysis,  we are looking at patterns in parking violations. We use parking citation data (from the City of San Francisco data portal) to explore the spatial distribution of citations and how they may relate to demographic data by Census Tract (from ACS 5-year estimates, pulled using an API.) We check to see how the spatial distribution of parking citations is correlated with the income, housing tenure, property value, and education level of the census tract where they were issued."

    "## 6 & 7) Preliminary Findings & Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main research question is how different factors influence driving in the city of San Francisco. As transportation planning students, we have studied the link between car dependency and economic, environmental, and land use factors. The state of California has passed legislation mandating that local planning departments enact policies that reduce overall vehicle miles traveled (VMT). We hope to uncover what factors most influence VMT levels within San Francisco.\n",
    "\n",
    "We intend to use a variety of data to investigate this topic. We are starting by looking at parking citations. The SFMTA provides public information about every citation issued in the city including the location and category of violation. By analyzing this data, we are investigating 1) where there is excess demand for parking in locations where curb space is heavily restricted and 2) what the enforcement patterns are for parking. We assume that citations are only issued in a small percentage of total parking violations, so understanding what factors influence where and when citations are issued helps us uncover what the parking enforcement patterns are. We hypothesize that citations are disproportionately issued in commercial corridors and in higher income residential neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first round of analysis involved identifying the most common types of parking violations. We cleaned our data to only include violation types with more than 1000 occurrences in the month of January 2022 so we had a better understanding of the data we are working with. We found that street cleaning and parking meter time limits were by far the most common categories. Our second step was to link housing tenure with violation frequencies. We intend to see what the correlation between income levels and parking violations are for tracts. As a first step, we found and plotted the distribution of income across tracts in the city. We found that the bulk of tracts fall between 100 and 200 thousand dollars with a high number at 250,000 and very low frequency at the low end of the income spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also want to understand patterns of car usage over time. To do this, we plan on using car registration data for the city cross referenced with transit ridership. By looking at the number of car registrations and transit ridership each year, we can see if there is a link. On the trip level, we can see if transit rides replace driving by looking for an inverse relationship between car and transit trips. We can use commute data from the Census as well as transit ridership numbers provided by the SFMTA and the MTC’s VitalSigns VMT tracker. Tracking trends in VMT and transit ridership will help solidify our findings. We can make interactive charts using plotly to create a visualization with an interactive sliding scale for time that shows how VMT and transit ridership trend over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another analysis we can make is the impact of rail versus bus on car usage. We can import the geodata on rail (Muni Metro and BART) stations and bus stations and use Census data that shows the number of vehicles used for commuting on a tract level. If we need to go to a lower level we can, but there should be interesting correlations between the number of transit stops within a tract and how many vehicles are used for commuting in that tract. We will plot the transit stops using matplotlib and use seaborn to color code the tracts based on the number of vehicles used for commuting. Then we can see if there is a link between transit access and auto commuting. We can also do a spatial join with the parking citation data to see what the link between auto commuting and parking citations is. A join with the demographic data can also help us understand which communities auto commute more."
