The more data and functions your code contains, the more important it is to arrange them into logical subgroups (classes) making sure that 1) related data and functions are grouped together and 2) unrelated data and functions do _not_ interfere with each other. Modular code is easier to read, modify, and reuse – and code reuse is valuable because it reduces development time."
